# Real-Time-Estimation-and-Control-For-Satellite-Orbit-Stabilization-
A project involving hardware-in-the-loop simulation of a satellite orbiting earth. The nonlinear system dynamics and noisy measurements are simulated in Python, while estimation and control algorithms are computed in C on a PSOC microcontroller. The simulation environment interfaces with our microcontroller via serial communication.
