Talk with prof Anwar:

could do multitasking with control and estimation of sattellite (would constantly be computing LQR inputs on PSOC, then would use interrupts to switch to estimation processing whenever a new measurement came into play. 

this is an example of hardware in the loop simulation

Control input via PSOC over serial (PSOC to python wont be 1ms, will be longer, its an abstraction), real-time processing is an abstraction

Still should setup structure of problem as if an interrupt is going on. 

simulation model would generate a pulse that would be a time pulse. 

serial generate an intterupt each time you recevie a packet in PSOC (a measurement coming from Python), using serial packet from Python at a consistent time (in SW abstraction next simulation state would represent spaces in the simulated space time)

simulation integration (runge-kutta) is not real time becuase adaptive algorithms will be slower at certain spots

if we model a linear system then a discrete time model (then we can do fixed simulation time)
(digital filter only works if plant is linear)

in programming processing order is actuation, sample, then control
